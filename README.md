# functional-snake
A very fun classic snake game written in JavaScript using the HTML5 Canvas element. This is an experiment to apply some of the functional programming and systematic program design techniques I've learned in the introductory computer science course (CPSC 110) at the University of British Columbia with a different language and environment. 

I choose JavaScript because I wanted to make the game accessible. All you need is a modern browser -- and that's pretty cool!
